title: Meetings
---
Our target was to have two meetings per week. One on Monday at 3pm, and another on Thursday at 4pm. We found that as time went by
we no longer felt the need to have two meetings as our team was small and quite intimate
and we'd usually be discussing our tasks with the team throughout the week. Our meetings also became shorter as a result.
